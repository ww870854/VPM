## What It Does

VPM helps you wrangle thousands of VAR packages without losing your mind. It scans your library, shows you what you have, and gives you tools to keep things tidy.

Repack packages with smaller textures or tweaked settings:

- **Texture resizing** - Downscale 8K textures to 4K, 2K, or 1K
- **Hair density** - Lower hair strand counts for smoother framerates
- **Shadow resolution** - Reduce light shadow maps
- **Mirror disabling** - Turn off mirrors in scenes
- **JSON minification** - Strip whitespace from scene files

All changes create a new optimized package - your originals stay untouched.
